## 6 Free Must-Read Books for Machine Learning and Data Science
- [Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)
    An intro to Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming from a computation/understanding-first, mathematics-second point of view. The Bayesian method is the natural approach to inference, yet it is hidden from readers behind chapters of slow, mathematical analysis. The typical text on Bayesian inference involves two to three chapters on probability theory, then enters what Bayesian inference is. Unfortunately, due to mathematical intractability of most Bayesian models, the reader is only shown simple, artificial examples. This can leave the user with a so-what feeling about Bayesian inference. In fact, this was the author's own prior opinion.
    
- [Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/)
    Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides a theoretical account of the fundamentals underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics, the book covers a wide array of central topics unaddressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds.
    
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
    This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.
    
- [Foundations of Data Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf)
    While traditional areas of computer science remain highly important, increasingly researchers of the future will be involved with using computers to understand and extract usable information from massive data arising in applications, not just how to make computers useful on specific well-defined problems. With this in mind we have written this book to cover the theory likely to be useful in the next 40 years, just as an understanding of automata theory, algorithms, and related topics gave students an advantage in the last 40 years.
    
- [A Programmer's Guide to Data Mining: The Ancient Art of the Numerati](http://guidetodatamining.com/)
    This guide follows a learn-by-doing approach. Instead of passively reading the book, I encourage you to work through the exercises and experiment with the Python code I provide. I hope you will be actively involved in trying out and programming data mining techniques. The textbook is laid out as a series of small steps that build on each other until, by the time you complete the book, you have laid the foundation for understanding data mining techniques.

- [Forecasting: Principles and Practices -2nd Edition](https://otexts.com/fpp2/): This textbook is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods using R and to present enough information about each method for readers to be able to use them sensibly. We don’t attempt to give a thorough discussion of the theoretical details behind each method, although the references at the end of each chapter will fill in many of those details.

    - Top Free Recommendation: [Learn SQL The Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
    
      This book will teach you the 80% of SQL you probably need to use it effectively, and will mix in concepts in data modeling at the same time. If you've been fumbling around building web, desktop, or mobile applications because you don't know SQL, then this book is for you. It is written for people with no prior database, programming, or SQL knowledge, but knowing at least one programming language will help.
    
10. Statistics for Data Science
    - Top Paid Recommendation: [Statistics in Plain English, Fourth Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Plain-English-Timothy-Urdan/dp/1138838330/)
    
      I work as a Data Analyst and deal with statistics on a daily basis. I am expected to know all the models and algorithms. Although statistical software does everything for me, figuring out the numbers the software chews out becomes the tricky part. I majored in Biotechnology and was alien to these statistics for the major part of my life. Long story short, I required a solid foundation guide that would help me get acclimatized to the concepts. - Shyam Goli, Amazon Review
    
    - Top Free Recommendation: [Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers, Second Edition](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)

## 5 eBooks to Read Before Getting into a MAchine Learning Career
- [Introduction to Machine Learning](http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/mlbook.html)
    Nils J. Nilsson of Stanford put these notes together in the mid 1990s. Before you turn up your nopse at the thought of learning from something from the 90s, remember that foundation is foundation, regardless of when it was written about. Sure, many important advancements have been made in machine learning since this was put together, as Nilsson himself says, but these notes cover much of what is still considered relevant elementary material in a straightforward and focused manner. There are no diversions related to advancements of the past few decades, which authors often want to cover tangentially even in introductory texts. There is, however, a lot of information about statistical learning, learning theory, classification, and a variety of algorithms to whet your appetite. At < 200 pages, this can be read rather quickly.

- [Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/copy.html)
    This book covering machine learning is written by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David. This book is newer, longer, and more advanced than the previous offering, but it is also a logical next step. This will delve deeper into more algorithms, their descriptions, and provide a bridge toward practicality as well. The focus on theory should be a clue to newcomers of its importance to really understand what is powering machine learning algorithms. The Advanced Theory section covers some concepts which may be beyond the scope or desire of a newcomer, but the option exists to have a look.

- [Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.Online)
    This introductory text on Bayesian machine learning is one of the most well-known on the topic as far as I am aware, and happens to have a free online version available. An Amazon review from Arindam Banerjee of the University of Minnesota has this to say:
    Bayesian Machine LearningThe book has wide coverage of probabilistic machine learning, including discrete graphical models, Markov decision processes, latent variable models, Gaussian process, stochastic and deterministic inference, among others. The material is excellent for advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate course in graphical models, or probabilistic machine learning. The exposition throughout the book uses numerous diagrams and examples, and the book comes with an extensive software toolbox...

    It should be noted that the toolbox being referred to is implemented in MATLAB, which is no longer the default machine learning implementation language, at least not generally. The toolbox is not the book's only virtue, however. This provides a great jumping off point for those interested in probabilistic machine learning.

- [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
    This is the soon-to-be-released-in-print deep learning book by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville, which has a freely-available final draft copy on its official website. The following 2 excerpts are from the book's website, one providing an overview of its contents, the other putting almost everyone interested in reading the book at ease:
    The Deep Learning textbook is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular. The online version of the book is now complete and will remain available online for free. The print version will be available for sale soon.
    One of these target audiences is university students(undergraduate or graduate) learning about machine learning, including those who are beginning a career in deep learning and artiﬁcial intelligence research. The other target audience is software engineers who do not have a machine learning or statistics background, but want to rapidly acquire one and begin using deep learning in their product or platform.

    You would be hard-pressed to find a better resource from which to learn all about deep learning.

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf)
    Sutton and Barto's authoritative classic is getting a makeover. This is a link to the second draft, which is currently in progress (and freely-available while it is).

    Reinforcement learning is of incredible research interest these days, and for good reason. Given its recent high-profile success as part of AlphaGo, its potential in self-driving cars and similar systems, and its marriage with deep learning, there is little reason to believe that reinforcement learning, which is undoubtedly to play a major role in any form of "General AI" (or anything resembling it), is going anywhere. Indeed, these are all reasons that a second draft of this book is in the works.

    You can get a sense of the importance of this book in the field of reinforcement learning given that it is referred to simply as "Sutton and Barto." This Amazon review from David Tan sums the book up nicely (and allays any fears related to "is it too complex for me to understand?"):

    The book starts with examples and intuitive introduction and definition of reinforcement learning. It follows with 3 chapters on the 3 fundamental approaches to reinforcement learning: Dynamic programming, Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference methods. Subsequent chapters build on these methods to generalize to a whole spectrum of solutions and algorithms.

    The book is very readable by average computer students. Possibly the only difficult one is chapter 8, which deals with some neural network concepts.

    Do keep in mind the above is in regards to the first edition; it should generalize to the second, however.
