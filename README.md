## Top 10 Essential Books for the Data Enthusiast
1. Data Science
    - Top Paid Recommendation: [Data Science for Business](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323/)
  
      When trying to learn about a new field, one of the most common difficulties is to find books (and other materials) that have the right "depth". All too often one ends up with either a friendly but largely useless book that oversimplifies or a heavy academic tome that, though authoritative and comprehensive, is condemned to sit gathering dust in one's shelves. "Data Science for Business" gets it just right.
  
    - Top Free Recommendation: [The Art of Data Science](https://leanpub.com/artofdatascience)
      
      This book describes the process of analyzing data in simple and general terms. The authors have extensive experience both managing data analysts and conducting their own data analyses, and this book is a distillation of their experience in a format that is applicable to both practitioners and managers in data science.
      
2. Big Data
    - Top Paid Recommendation: [Big Data: Principles and Best Practices of Scalable Realtime Data Systems](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Principles-practices-scalable/dp/1617290343/)
    
      I have rarely seen a thorough discussion of the importance of data modelling, data layers, data processing requirements analysis, and data architecture and storage implementation issues (along with other "traditional" database concepts) in the context of big data. This book delivers a refreshing comprehensive solution to that deficiency. - Kirk D. Borne, Amazon Review
    
    - Top Free Recommendation: [Big Data Now: 2016 Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/big-data-now-2016-edition.csp)
    
      In the four years that Oâ€™Reilly has produced its annual Big Data Now report, the data field has grown from infancy into young adulthood. Data is now a leader in some fields and a driver of innovation in others, and companies that use data and analytics to drive decision-making are outperforming their peers.

      The information that is available on the Internet is great, but this book brings much of it together in one place. If you want to learn to think like a Spark programmer--*not* the same as thinking like a programmer--this is the place to begin. - Brian Castelli, Amazon Review
    
    - Top Free Recommendation: [Mastering Apache Spark](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jaceklaskowski/mastering-apache-spark/details)
    
      This collections of notes (what some may rashly call a "book") serves as the ultimate place of mine to collect all the nuts and bolts of using Apache Spark. The notes aim to help me designing and developing better products with Spark.
    
5. Theoretical Machine Learning
    - Top Paid Recommendation: [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738/)
    
      The author is an expert, this is evidenced by the excellent insights he gives into the complex math behind the machine learning algorithms. I have worked for quite some time with neural networks and have had coursework in linear algebra, probability and regression analysis, and found some of the stuff in the book quite illuminating. - Sidhant, Amazon Review
    
    - Top Free Recommendation: [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
    
      The good news is, this is pretty much the most important book you are going to read in the space. It will tie everything together for you in a way that I haven't seen any other book attempt. - Enceladus Transit, Amazon Review
    
6. Practical Machine Learning
    - Top Paid Recommendation: [Python Machine Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130/)
    
      This is a fantastic book, even for a relative beginner to machine learning such as myself. The first thing that comes to mind after reading this book is that it was the perfect blend (for me at least) of theory and practice, as well as breadth and depth. - Brian M. Thomas, Amazon Review
    
    - Top Free Recommendation: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
    
      This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.
    
7. Deep Learning
    - Top Paid Recommendation: []()
    
      
    
    - Top Free Recommendation #1: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
    
      Neural Networks and Deep Learning is a free online book. The book will teach you about:
      -- Neural networks, a beautiful biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data

    - Top Free Recommendation #2: [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
    
      The in-preparation, likely to-be definitive deep learning book of the near future, written by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. The development version is updated monthly, and will be freely available until publication.
      
8. Data Mining
    - Top Paid Recommendation: [Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, Third Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Concepts-Techniques-Management/dp/0123814790/)
    
      Data Mining is a comprehensive overview of the field, and I think it is best for a graduate class in data mining, or perhaps as a reference book. The book's focus is on technique (i.e., how to analyze data, including preparation), and it addresses all the major topics in the field including data storage and pre-processing. However, the book is really about classification methods, and the 2 chapters on cluster analysis are particularly strong and thorough. - Susan Katz, Amazon Review
    
    - Top Free Recommendation: [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/)
    
      The book, like the course, is designed at the undergraduate computer science level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with further reading references.
    
9. SQL
    - Top Paid Recommendation: [Learning SQL, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-SQL-Alan-Beaulieu/dp/0596520832/)
    
      If you're writing any type of database driven code and you think that you don't need to understand SQL, read this book. You do need to understand it, and this book teaches it very well. - Jack D. Herrington, Amazon Review
    
    - Top Free Recommendation: [Learn SQL The Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
    
      This book will teach you the 80% of SQL you probably need to use it effectively, and will mix in concepts in data modeling at the same time. If you've been fumbling around building web, desktop, or mobile applications because you don't know SQL, then this book is for you. It is written for people with no prior database, programming, or SQL knowledge, but knowing at least one programming language will help.
    
10. Statistics for Data Science
    - Top Paid Recommendation: [Statistics in Plain English, Fourth Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Plain-English-Timothy-Urdan/dp/1138838330/)
    
      I work as a Data Analyst and deal with statistics on a daily basis. I am expected to know all the models and algorithms. Although statistical software does everything for me, figuring out the numbers the software chews out becomes the tricky part. I majored in Biotechnology and was alien to these statistics for the major part of my life. Long story short, I required a solid foundation guide that would help me get acclimatized to the concepts. - Shyam Goli, Amazon Review
    
    - Top Free Recommendation: [Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers, Second Edition](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)
    
      Think Stats emphasizes simple techniques you can use to explore real data sets and answer interesting questions. The book presents a case study using data from the National Institutes of Health. Readers are encouraged to work on a project with real datasets.
